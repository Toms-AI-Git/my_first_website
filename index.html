<!-- First line -->
<p class="journal-entry">On Dec. 31. 2022 I had the first contact with OpenAIs ChatGPT at a new years party. The 17 year old boy of the family showed it to us.</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">I was completely hooked right away. My head was spinning, realizing what kind of technology that was and it might mean for our future.</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">Some days later, after checking it out, I phoned my friends telling them about "it" and strongly suggested, that they should give it a look.</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">The first steps: trying to get to know the system, f.e. by asking it for advice how it wanted to be prompted = kind of "meta communication".</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">At a very early stage I discovered "role prompting" - I watched it discuss topics in the role of "different aged persons" or politicians.</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">As soon as possible I went for the PLUS-version, in order to gain access whenever I wanted and I wanted quite often. Never had any regret.</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">Using the AI as a programming tool was of early interest as me not being a coder: Starting with my Arduino trying out automotive solutions.</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">I spent a fairly amount of time watching the new market of interest, knowledge and ideas including different LLMs and local solutions.</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">By using several extensions in the "pre plugin era", ChatGPT could be enhanced f.e. to browse the web - not really well at that early state.</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">The introduction of Bing chat was a milestone. Been there from the beginning. First version was kind of odd to me- reacting kind of strange.</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">Always being interested in psychological themes and conversations, I tried out lots of approaches in fields of human nature and philosophie.</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">P.I. is VERY special in that sense. Obviously specially developed to offer a very "human like" conversation experience, we talked about a lot.</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">I got more and more interested in knowledge acquisition with the help of AI - f.e. summarizing YT-transcripts before watching the video.</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">Next ChatGPT milestone - introducing plugins. f.e. videoinsight (see above...) lots of interesting stuff but some rubbish as well...?!?</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">Got my first OpenAi API. Proud moment to venture into new territory. Very special moment to use my secret API-key for the first time.</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">First versions of "GPT-Agents" and GPT4ALL with beta PDF-reader to include individual data-base knowledge - interesting and future topic.</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">Tried out non-coding chatbot creation like Flowise. Automation solution like "bardeen", impressive data-analysis tool like "noteable" plugin.</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">"code-interpreter" another ChatGPT milestone changed the AI world - at least for me. Even more ~programming~: Python, SQL, JSON, HTML, JS, CSS.</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">Developed lots of small but very meaningful and practical tools to convert file-types, creating files and transcripts, voice to text and much more.</p>

<!-- New entry -->
<p class="journal-entry">Checked out Claude 2 as well. Great to discuss big PDF-files. Even better than ChatGPT. New stuff every week/day... Hard to keep track...</p>

<!-- 30th line -->
<p class="journal-entry">Below is an AI demo project: basis: Kaggle SQL database file converted to JSON. HTML,JS,CSS codes mostly AI generated.</p>
